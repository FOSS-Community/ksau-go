# Advanced Features

## Custom Configurations
You can customize the tool's behavior by modifying the configuration file located at:
- Linux/macOS: `$HOME/.ksau/.conf/rclone.conf`
- Windows: `%AppData%\ksau\.conf\rclone.conf`

## Performance Optimization
### Adjusting Chunk Size
To optimize upload performance, you can adjust the chunk size:
```bash
ksau-go upload --file /path/to/local/file --remote /path/to/remote/folder --chunk-size 10485760
```

### Increasing Timeout
For large file uploads, increase the timeout setting:
```bash
ksau-go upload --file /path/to/local/file --remote /path/to/remote/folder --timeout 60s
```

## Security Best Practices
### Encrypting Configuration Files
Ensure your configuration files are encrypted and stored securely. Use tools like GPG to encrypt sensitive files.

### Using Environment Variables
Store sensitive information in environment variables instead of configuration files. For example:
```bash
export KSAU_GO_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Integration with Other Tools
### Using with Cron Jobs
Automate uploads using cron jobs:
```bash
(crontab -l ; echo "0 2 * * * ksau-go upload --file /path/to/local/file --remote /path/to/remote/folder") | crontab -
```

### Using with CI/CD Pipelines
Integrate ksau-go with your CI/CD pipelines to automate deployments and backups. Add the following to your CI/CD configuration:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Upload to OneDrive
    run: ksau-go upload --file /path/to/local/file --remote /path/to/remote/folder
```

## Command Aliases and Shortcuts
### Creating Aliases
Create aliases for frequently used commands to save time:
```bash
alias ksau-upload='ksau-go upload'
alias ksau-refresh='ksau-go refresh'
```
Add these lines to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `$PROFILE` for PowerShell) and reload the configuration.

### Using Shell Functions
Create shell functions for complex command sequences:
```bash
ksau_backup() {
  ksau-go upload --file /path/to/local/directory --remote /path/to/remote/backup --recursive
}
```
Add this function to your shell configuration file and reload the configuration.

## Additional Tips
- Regularly update the tool to get the latest features and bug fixes.
- Refer to the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md) for common issues and solutions.
- Ensure your configuration file is properly formatted and contains all necessary settings.
